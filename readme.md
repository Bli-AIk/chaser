## Introduction

`chaser` is an automated file path synchronization tool. It solves a common pain point: when paths or files referenced in configuration files change, you always need to manually update the corresponding paths in the configuration files.

With `chaser`, you only need to perform simple configuration, and it will automatically monitor changes to specified paths and update related references in configuration files in real-time. It can be closed after use.

In the future, it will also support running as a daemon process.

## Features

* Automatically tracks file and directory path changes (renaming, moving).
* Updates the corresponding paths in specified configuration files.
* Lightweight and easy to configure.
* (Planned) Can be run as a daemon.

## How to Use
